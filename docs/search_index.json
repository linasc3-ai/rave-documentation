Correctly installing the following pre-requisites is necessary for RAVE to work properly. Note: RAVE requires the latest versions of R and RStudio to run properly. To avoid errors in the download process, if you already have R and RStudio on your computer, be sure they are updated to the most recent versions. 2.1.1 MacOS 2.1.1.1 Install Homebrew Homebrew is a package manager that adds functions missing from the Apple operating system. It can be installed by copying and pasting the following line into your terminal (note: the terminal can be found through searching the applications folder on your computer): /bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot; If you have not downloaded Homebrew to your computer before, you will be prompted with the following questions: ==&gt; Checking for `sudo` access (which may request your password)... Password: Enter your user password. Note that the password won’t be displayed into the screen as you type for security reasons. Once you’ve finish typing, press the RETURN or ENTER key to proceed. ==&gt; This script will install: ... Press RETURN/ENTER to continue or any other key to abort: Please press the RETURN or ENTER key to continue. Add brew to path The terminal commands used to add homebrew to the path depend on your computer’s CPU chip. Copy and paste the appropriate command lines into the terminal based on your computer’s chip type. For M1 Chips echo &#39;eval &quot;$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.zprofile echo &#39;eval &quot;$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.profile echo &#39;eval &quot;$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile For Intel Chips 2.1.1.2 Install R Language Download and install the latest version of R directly from the website: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ Be sure to download the package that corresponds to your computer’s OS version and CPU type. For Intel Macs, download R-X.X.X.pkg For M1 Macs, download R-X.X.X-arm64.pkg 2.1.1.3 Install RStudio Desktop Download and install RStudio Desktop directly from the website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Be sure to download the version that corresponds to your OS system. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. Screenshot of RStudio Website 2.1.1.4 Install system libraries You will need to download the libraries hdf5, fftw, and pkg-config. This can be done by copying and pasting the following line into your terminal: brew install hdf5 fftw pkg-config 2.1.1.5 Troubleshooting Possible errors and their recommended fixes: If you have multiple accounts on your computer but only one of them has homebrew installed, you may receive a “the following directories are not writable by your user” error. To resolve this error, you can change the ownership of the directories to the current user and make sure this user has write permission. When executing step 2.1.1.4 (installing hdf5, fftw, and pkg-config), if you receive the error “No available formula with the name”hdf5”., there might bee an issue with the location of Homebrew. Try the following commands in your terminal: rm -rf &quot;/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core&quot; and then brew tap homebrew/core 2.2 Install RAVE Now that you have installed the pre-requisites, follow the steps below to download and install the RAVE package on your computer. 2.2.1 Download and Configure Open the RStudio application and click on the Console tab (if RStudio is set to default settings, this tab is usually located in bottom left panel of your screen). Copy and paste the following command onto the console to download the RAVE packages from the online repository and install them on your computer: options(repos = c(ropensci = &#39;https://beauchamplab.r-universe.dev&#39;, CRAN = &#39;https://cloud.r-project.org&#39;)) install.packages(c(&#39;rave&#39;, &#39;ravebuiltins&#39;)) Copy and paste the following command onto the console to update RAVE to the latest available version (this will account for recent bug fixes and newly added features): rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE) Copy and paste the following command onto the console to: * Download template brain (N27, fsaverage) for electrode template mapping * Download demo subject data for single- and group-level analyses rave::finalize_installation(upgrade = &#39;ask&#39;) 2.2.1.1 Troubleshooting When updating RAVE, if you receive a “timeout of 60 seconds was reached” warning message, try switching to a faster network connection. 2.2.2 Validate the Installation To check whether RAVE was properly installed, copy and paste the following commands onto the console to start the program: rave::start_rave() If installation was successful, a new web browser window should automatically open with the RAVE display. A screenshot is shown below: RAVE Start Screen You have successfully downloaded RAVE! 2.2.2.1 Troubleshooting ** The RAVE data should be located [default location]. If located elsewhere on the window, copy and paste the following command onto the console to set the data directory to the correct location: rave::rave_options() 2.3 Updating RAVE after download If you’ve already downloaded RAVE and simply wish to update the application to the most recent version, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE) Note: When re-updating, a pop-up might appear in RStudio asking if you want to reinstall the N27 template brain. Because the template is already installed, click no. What’s Next Now that you’ve completed installation, visit the following pages to start using RAVE! Starting RAVE Change RAVE settings "],["get-started.html", "Chapter 3 Get Started 3.1 Starting RAVE 3.2 Closing RAVE 3.3 Change RAVE Settings", " Chapter 3 Get Started Now that you’ve successfully installed RAVE, review the following instructions to get started using it. 3.1 Starting RAVE Note: you must quit and restart RStudio if you have just downloaded or updated RAVE in order for the application to start successfully. After restarting RStudio, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console to open RAVE: rave::start_rave() RAVE will display in a new web browser (Google Chrome is recommended for optimal use). 3.2 Closing RAVE To completely close the RAVE server: 1). Click the red stop sign in the bottom left panel of RStudio (refer to the screenshot below to find the stop sign). Screenshot of RStudio console stop sign 2). Quit the RStudio application. If asked whether you want to Save workspace image?, click no. Note: Closing the RAVE display tab on your web browser will only close the display, not the actual RAVE server. 3.3 Change RAVE Settings To access and change RAVE settings, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: rave::rave_options() Modules: Summary of all RAVE modules Core Settings: Allows you to change where RAVE data is stored. System: Allows you to change RAM and number of CPU cores RAVE can use to alter speed at which data is read 3D Viewer: Allows you to change which downloaded brain data to use as the template brain for electrode template mapping; the default template brain is N27. Note: In general, you must stop processes that are currently being executed by the console before trying to initiate another command. To do this, click the red stop sign on the bottom left panel of RStudio. For example, if you have just opened RAVE and wish to update the application, click the red stop sign.
