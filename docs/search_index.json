By default, RAVE already has a DemoSubject whose raw data has already been imported and preprocessed (not sure – double check). You can also download other demo subjects by copying and pasting the following command into the RStudio console: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;subject_code&quot;) You will need to substitute “subject_code” with one of the available demo subjects: KC, YAB, YAD, YAF, YAH, YAI, YAJ, and YAK. For example, to download subject YAB, use the following command: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAB&quot;) Note that downloaded demo data will be stored in the raw_dir folder of the rave_data folder in your home directory. Within raw_dir, each subject’s data is stored in its own folder (e.g. YAB’s data will be stored in the YAB folder in raw_dir). Refer to the following screenshot for clarity. Screenshot of location of downloaded demo data 4.2 Importing demo data To launch the RAVE Preprocessing module, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: rave::rave_preprocess() The Preprocessing module will then open in a browser window, allowing you to see the Overview page. The Overview page allows you to import raw iEEG data into RAVE "]]
