"],["importing-demo-data.html", "4.2 Importing demo data", " 4.2 Importing demo data You will need to launch the RAVE preprocessing module. Copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: rave::rave_preprocess() The Preprocessing module will then open in a browser window, allowing you to see the Overview page. The Overview page is where you will import or load your data into RAVE. It consists of three panels. * Overview: this is where you will specify your inputs and configurations. * Information: a summary of your inputs and configurations is shown here. * Import Widgets Proceed to the overview panel to specify these inputs and configurations. 4.2.1 Step 1: Select Subject Enter the code for the demo subject whose iEEG data you want to import into RAVE. Note that a subject‚Äôs data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within therave_data folder. E.g. if you want to select demo subject KC, enter ‚ÄúKC‚Äù and you should receive the following message letting you know the subject has been found: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/raw_dir/KC (found!) 4.2.2 Step 2: Select Project or Create New One This step allows you to specify where you want the cleaned data to be stored. If you wish to create a new project, select ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the data directory (data_dir) within rave_data, with a new folder for the subject. E.g. if you wish to store demo subject KC in a new project called ‚ÄúTest‚Äù, you should receive the following message: Subject [Test/KC] will be stored at: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/data_dir/Test/KC Then, click ‚Äúcreate subject‚Äù to proceed. 4.2.3 Step 3: Validate Data In this step, you will have to specify your desired electrode (aka channel) options: Folders: Each folder corresponds to a block, aka a period or session of continuous electrode recording. Select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. (E.g. for KC, you could select blocks 003 and 004.) Electrodes: Indicate the electrodes you want to analyze. Note that it is reccomended that you run the preprocessing steps on all electrodes at once. (E.g. for KC, you should indicate 1-92.) Sample Rate: Indicate the sample rate of your iEEG recording equipment; this value will determine the rate at which the preprocessing will be run. For demo subjects, you can indicate 2000. Physical Unit: Indicate the units you wish to use to measure voltage. Demo data can be kept at the default as-is (no change) option. File Format: RAVE currently supports six file formats for your iEEG data. Demo data is stored using .mat/.h5 files, in which one file represents one electrode in a given block. (For guidance when selecting a file format, RAVE will briefly describe the format and display a sample organization of the directory.) Click the Check Subject button to proceed. (Note: this process can take a few minutes; progress will be displayed via pop-ups in the bottom right.) Click the Start Import button to proceed. (Note: this process can take a few minutes.) You have successfully imported a demo subject into RAVE. You can proceed to the preprocessing modules for further cleaning of this data. The following screenshot summarizes the data loading process: "],["importing-your-own-data.html", "4.3 Importing Your Own Data", " 4.3 Importing Your Own Data If you‚Äôre ready to start using RAVE with your own data, follow the steps below to import the data so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules. 4.3.1 Organizing Your Directories rave::archive_subject "],["preprocessing.html", "Chapter 5 Preprocessing", " Chapter 5 Preprocessing "],["part-one.html", "5.1 Part One", " 5.1 Part One Step #1: Import Signals Now that you have installed and gotten started with RAVE, you can proceed to importing your iEEG data into the software so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules. Step 1.1: Select project &amp; subject First, use the drop down menu to specify which project you want the cleaned subject data to be stored in. If you wish to create a new project, select ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the rave_data folder of the data directory (data_dir), in a new folder for your subject. Next, use the drop down menu to select the code for the subject whose data you want to import. Note that a subject‚Äôs data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within therave_data folder. Click the ‚ÄúCreate Subject‚Äù button to proceed to the next step. Step 1.2: Format &amp; session blocks RAVE defines a block/session as a period of continuous electrode recording. Here, you should first select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. Note that when you select a block, a preview of the files it contains will pop-up to the right. This feature helps you check that the way you‚Äôve stored your data is consistent with the file type you‚Äôve selected. Then, specify the file format your iEEG data is stored in. RAVE currently supports four file formats: .mat/.h5 file per electrode per block single .mat/.h5 file per block single EDF(+) file per block single BrainVision file Note that when you select a format from the drop down, a brief description of the specific format will pop-up underneath the menu. For more information on these file types, visit the Q&amp;A at Importing Data Step 1.3: Channel information RAVE equates a channel to an electrode. Set the following specifications for your channels: Data file: Channel numbers: Indicate the electrodes you wish to analyze. It is recommended that you run the preprocessing steps on all electrodes at once. Note that RAVE can automatically detect potential electrodes based on the specified blocks and file type; this suggestion is displayed at the bottom of the panel. Physical unit: Indicate the units you wish to use to measure voltage. Sample rate: Indicate the rate of your iEEG recording equipment; this value will determine the rate at which the preprocessing will be run. Now, select the Validate &amp; Import button to validate your data. A pop-up will soon appear asking if you are ready to import your data. Please double check all the information you entered is correct, and then select the Import Data button to proceed. You will see a progress bar in the bottom left corner. A pop-up will soon appear indicating that you have successfully imported your subject data into RAVE! You can now use the menu on the left side of the screen to select the first preprocessing module, notch filter. Step #2: Notch Filter What is a notch filter? A notch filter blocks a given frequency or a narrow range of frequencies (aka a ‚Äúbandwidth‚Äù) from a signal without affecting the rest of that signal. It is often used to minimize line noise interference in raw iEEG data, which helps ensure that future analyses only consider actual brain data. A common source of this interference is the amplifier used in recording set-ups to convert electrode signals into a form readable by the computer. This interference is commonly introduced at 60 Hz, since that is the standard frequency used in the North American electrical grid system. To apply the notch filter, RAVE performs a fast fourier transform (FFT) of the signal. To learn more about FFT, visit the Q&amp;A section at Notch Filter. To apply the notch filter to your data, follow the steps below. Begin in the Data Selection window to specify which data you want to perform the notch filter on . Use the drop down to indicate the desired project and subject. Note that you can press the Sync from [Import LFP] module link to automatically select the project and subject that you just imported in the Import Signals module. Proceed by selecting the Load Subject button. A new screen will load with three panels: Filter Settings, Inspection, and Notch. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. Sample Notch Filter Screen Filter Settings: Begin my indicating your desired configurations for the filter(s). Base frequency refers to the frequency introduced by the amplifier that you want to remove. By default, this is set as 60 Hz as that is the frequency introduced by most iEEG amplifiers. x Times sets the multipliers of the base frequency you want removed by the filter. This feature allows you to account for harmonics (waves with frequencies that are positive integer multiples of the base frequency), which result because the signal from the amplifier is not a pure sine wave when undergoing FFT analysis. By default, this value is set as ‚Äú1,2,3‚Äù based on the harmonics that commonly result in iEEG recording set-ups. This default means that 60 Hz (base frequency * 1), 120 Hz (base frequency * 2), 180 Hz (base frequency * 3) are the frequencies that the notch filter will remove. +- Bandwidth (Hz) refers to how wide you wish to make each filter; a higher number will remove a wider range of frequencies whereas a lower number will remove a narrower range of frequencies. You should enter one number for each filter you have. By default, this value is set to 1,2,2 ‚Äì in other words, your filters will remove the bandwidths 59 - 61 Hz (aka 60 Hz +/- 1), 118 - 122 Hz (aka 120 Hz +/- 2), 178 - 182 Hz (aka 180 Hz +/- 2) respectively. Based on these configurations, the bottom of the panel will automatically display a summary of how many filters you have and the bandwidths each will remove. Click the blue Apply Notch Filters button to apply the filters to your data. A pop-up will appear showing a summary of your configurations. Click ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù to proceed. Inspection: Controls settings of the figures displayed in the Notch: Inspect Signals panel located to the right. Use the block and electrode drop down menus to select the data you wish to display in the Notch: Inspect Signals panel. You can use the previous and next buttons to easily switch between which electrode you‚Äôre viewing within a selected recording session. The window length slider controls the power range displayed for the Welch periodograms. The more you move the slider to the right, the wider the dB range on the y-axis. The frequency limit slider controls the frequency range for the Welch periodograms. The more you move the slider to the right, the higher the frequencies that will be displayed on the x-axis. The number of histogram bins slider controls how wide the voltage ranges on the horizontal axis of the histogram are, where each bin represents a vertical bar on the graph. Choosing a larger number will create narrower voltage ranges and thus more vertical bars, whereas choosing a smaller number will create wider voltage ranges and thus fewer vertical bars. Moving the slider can give you a more precise look at which voltages are most represented in the electrode signal. Notch: Inspect Signals: Displays *raw and filtered iEEG signals for each channel whose data was imported The top Local Field Potential Graph plots voltage versus time in seconds to show the raw signal that was recorded from the selected electrode. The red lines on the graph reflect the normalization The leftmost Welch Periodogram estimates the power of the signal at its component frequencies. Before applying the notch filter, only the original graph will be shown in grey. After you‚Äôve applied the notch filter, the filtered signal will be shown in red; you should visibly see the power of the signal reduced at the base and harmonic frequencies. To learn more about the calculation of the Welch Periodogram, visit the Q&amp;A at Notch Filter. The center Welch Periodogram is the same as the leftmost periodogram, except it is transformed to have a logarithmic x-axis. This graph makes viewing the signals at lower frequencies easier. The Histogram Original plots frequency on the vertical axis and voltage on the horizontal axis to depict how often each range of voltages occurs in the signal. If you wish to download these figures, simply click the Download as PDF link at the bottom of the Inspection panel. This will generate a PDF file in a new tab with a slide for each electrode within each block. Step #3: Wavelet Once you click the wavelet tab on the left menu, a data selection window will appear for you to select the project and subject whose data you wish to apply wavelet decomposition to. You can once again click the ‚Äúsync from [import LFP] module‚Äù to automatically select the subject you just imported. Note: You must have applied the notch filter to your selected subject before trying to apply the wavelet transformation. After selecting the ‚ÄúLoad Subject‚Äù button, a new screen will load with two panels: Wavelet Settings and Wavelet Kernel. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. Sample Wavelet Decomposition Screen Wavelet decomposition is a type of time frequency analysis that is used for non-stationary signals (i.e.¬†properties change over time), like that of iEEG. It separates the signal into differing frequency and phase components, which is helpful because signals in the brain are very dynamic. This process makes it so that changes in the signal‚Äôs power spectra can be visualized across both frequency and time. To learn more about how wavelet transform works, visit the Q&amp;A at Wavelet. In this module, RAVE can: - downsample the signal before running the wavelet, if desired - run a wavelet on each block in the selected subject‚Äôs folder - downsample the wavelet coefficients to 100.0 Hz to reduce the amount of space needed to save the information onto your computer‚Äôs disk Wavelet Settings: Begin by setting the basic configurations: In Power sample rate, enter the rate used in the iEEG recording experiment. By default, this is set to 100 Hz. The Down-sample before wavelet drop down menu will allow you to select a factor of 1, 2, 4, or 8 to use to reduce the sample rate. Reducing the sampling rate is commonly done to run the wavelet transform faster and use less of the computer‚Äôs disk space. Note that selecting 1 means you do not want to reduce the sampling rate, and that reducing the rate by a higher factor allows for analyzing a greater frequency range. If you wish to reduce the amount of time it takes to run the wavelet, please select the use single float precision checkbox. Please note, though, that this option will also _____. Proceed by setting your frequency and cycle configurations: The select method to generate wavelet parameters drop down menu allows you to ____. By default, it is set to ‚Äúbuilt in‚Äù to allow you to set your frequency and cycle configurations using the RAVE interface. If you select ‚Äúupload preset,‚Äù an upload button will appear. (Note that your preset configurations should be in the form of a csv with two columns, frequency and cycles. You can proceed straight to running the wavelet via the blue ‚Äúrun wavelet‚Äù button if you upload your own preset.) Use the frequency range slider to select the range of frequencies you wish to decompose with the wavelet. Use the frequency step size slider Use the wavelet cycles slider to choose the range of cycles you wish to use in the transform. Note that a larger number of cycles will lead to more precise frequency analysis, whereas a smaller number of cycles will lead to more precise temporal analysis. Wavelet Kernel: The Wavelet Kernels (Real &amp; Imaginary) graph The Wavelet Length | Frequency graph The Wavelet Cycle | Frequency graph If you wish to download the kernel parameters, click the blue download kernel parameters link at the bottom of the window. This will generate a csv file with each frequency and its corresponding number of cycles. When finished setting the configurations and reviewing the figures, select the blue Run Wavelet button. As shown below, a pop-up will appear on the screen asking you to confirm the subject, frequencies, # of cycles, and precision that you selected for the wavelet transformation. Click ‚Äúconfirm‚Äù to proceed, or ‚Äúconfirm and run in background‚Äù if you wish to continue using RAVE during the decomposition process. Note that this process can take up to 30 minutes; progress bars for each task will be displayed in the lower right corner.

Answer: You forgot to download this demo subject before importing them. You can use the following command to download the demo subject YAI: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAI&quot;) Question: Where does the demo data come from? &gt; Answer: The demo data available in RAVE is sourced from experiments run by the Beauchamp Lab at the Perelman School of Medicine, which investigates the neural mechanisms for multisensory integration and visual perception in human subjects.

Question: In step 3, why are the ‚Äúfolders‚Äù and ‚Äúelectrode‚Äù fields designated as ‚Äúread-only‚Äù? Answer: If these fields are designated as ‚Äúread only,‚Äù this means you have already imported the entered subject. To preserve reproducibility, once raw data for a subject is imported and notch filtered, you can not change the channel options. Question: In step 3, what does the term ‚Äúblock‚Äù refer to? Answer: RAVE defines ‚Äúblock‚Äù as a period or session of continuous recording. A block should be named with a zero-padded integer according to the order they were recorded (e.g.¬†001 for the first session, 002 for the second). Question: On the import widgets panel at bottom right, I got a message that electrode files are missing. How do I resolve this? Answer: When you hit the ‚Äúcheck subject‚Äù button, the bottom right panel will let you know if any electrode files are missing based on the electrode numbers you entered in step three. Be sure to double check that you indicated the correct electrode numbers in step 3. Question: Does RAVE automatically validate my data? Answer: You should check for yourself to make sure that each block contains the appropriate files. RAVE will not automatically check this for you. Question: How do I know which file format to select in step 3? Answer: When you select a file format from the drop down, RAVE will display brief information on what that format entails and a sample organization for the data directory. Select the format that matches that of your data. Question: Where are my inputs and configurations stored for a given subject? Answer: This information is stored within data_dir/&lt;project&gt;/subject&gt;/rave/preprocess/rave.yaml of your home directory. "],["notch-filter.html", "6.5 Notch Filter", " 6.5 Notch Filter Question: What is fast fourier transform (FFT)? Answer: FFT is an algorithm that can quickly compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a signal. It transforms the signal from a function of time to the a fucntion of frequency by dividing the signal into its frequency components. Each component constitutes an oscillation with a unique amplitude. This procedure makes it easier to extract a base frequency and its harmonics (e.g.¬†of the amplifier) to perform the notch filter. Question: What is a Welch Periodogram? Answer: The Welch method allows for the estimation of the power of a signal at its component frequencies. The time signal is separated into individual blocks, a periodogram is created for each block, and then these periodograms are averaged to estimate the power. The Welch method reduces noise in the power estimation compared to other methods. (Note: a periodogram identifies the dominant frequencies in a time signal.) Question: How can I switch between subjects while on the notch filter or wavelet modules? Answer: In the bottom right corner of the screen, there is a rectangular button that lists the project and subject you‚Äôre currently analyzing ‚Äì e.g.¬†‚Äúdemo/YAD‚Äù. Click that button to go back to the load data screen and select a different project and/or subject. Question: I‚Äôve already performed the notch filter, but RAVE is not letting me update my channel options. How can I fix this? Answer: Once the data is imported and notch filtered, you cannot change the channel options. You should make a new project to change the channel options in this case. Question: This error popped up when I tried loading a subject into the notch filter module. What do I do? ‚ÄúFound an error while loading the power data: The subject exists but its signal has not been imported yet.‚Äù Answer: Use the menu at left to go back to the ‚Äúimport signals‚Äù module. You will need to import that subject using the ‚Äúvalidate &amp; import‚Äù button. "],["wavelet.html", "6.6 Wavelet", " 6.6 Wavelet Question: What does wavelet transformation actually entail? Answer: A complex wavelet will undergo convulotion with the iEEG signal. The iEEG signal will then be translated across the time axis, using either high frequency or low frequency wavelets. The result is good frequency resolution but poor temporal resolution at low frequencies, and good temporal resolution and poor frequency resolution at high frequencies. Note that a wavelet is created by multiplying a Gaussian function with a sine function.
