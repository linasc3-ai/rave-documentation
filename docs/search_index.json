Step 1.1: Select project &amp; subject First, use the drop down menu to specify which project you want the cleaned subject data to be stored in. If you wish to create a new project, select “New Project” from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the rave_data folder of the data directory (data_dir), in a new folder for your subject. Next, use the drop down menu to select the code for the subject whose data you want to import. Note that a subject’s data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within therave_data folder. Click the “Create Subject” button to proceed to the next step. Step 1.2: Format &amp; session blocks RAVE defines a block/session as a period of continuous electrode recording. Here, you should first select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. Note that when you select a block, a preview of the files it contains will pop-up to the right. This feature helps you check that the way you’ve stored your data is consistent with the file type you’ve selected. Then, specify the file format your iEEG data is stored in. RAVE currently supports four file formats: .mat/.h5 file per electrode per block single .mat/.h5 file per block single EDF(+) file per block single BrainVision file Note that when you select a format from the drop down, a brief description of the specific format will pop-up underneath the menu. For more information on these file types, visit the Q&amp;A at Importing Data Step 1.3: Channel information RAVE equates a channel to an electrode. Set the following specifications for your channels: Data file: Channel numbers: Indicate the electrodes you wish to analyze. It is recommended that you run the preprocessing steps on all electrodes at once. Note that RAVE can automatically detect potential electrodes based on the specified blocks and file type; this suggestion is displayed at the bottom of the panel. Physical unit: Indicate the units you wish to use to measure voltage. Sample rate: Indicate the rate of your iEEG recording equipment; this value will determine the rate at which the preprocessing will be run. Now, select the Validate &amp; Import button to validate your data. A pop-up will soon appear asking if you are ready to import your data. Please double check all the information you entered is correct, and then select the Import Data button to proceed. You will see a progress bar in the bottom left corner. A pop-up will soon appear indicating that you have successfully imported your subject data into RAVE! You can now use the menu on the left side of the screen to select the first preprocessing module, notch filter. Step #2: Notch Filter What is a notch filter? A notch filter blocks a given frequency or a narrow range of frequencies (aka a “bandwidth”) from a signal without affecting the rest of that signal. It is often used to minimize line noise interference in raw iEEG data, which helps ensure that future analyses only consider actual brain data. A common source of this interference is the amplifier used in recording set-ups to convert electrode signals into a form readable by the computer. This interference is commonly introduced at 60 Hz, since that is the standard frequency used in the North American electrical grid system. To apply the notch filter to your data, follow the steps below. Begin in the Data Selection window to specify which data you want to perform the notch filter on . Use the drop down to indicate the desired project and subject. Note that you can press the Sync from [Import LFP] module link to automatically select the project and subject that you just imported in the Import Signals module. Proceed by selecting the Load Subject button. A new screen will load with three panels: Filter Settings, Inspection, and Notch. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. Sample Notch Filter Screen Filter Settings: Begin my indicating your desired configurations for the filter(s). Base frequency refers to the frequency introduced by the amplifier that you want to remove. By default, this is set as 60 Hz as that is the frequency introduced by most iEEG amplifiers. x Times sets the number of filters you want to use. +- Bandwidth (Hz) refers to how wide you wish to make each filter; a higher number will remove a wider range of frequencies whereas a lower number will remove a narrower range of frequencies. You should enter one number for each filter you have. By default, this value is set to 1,2,2 – in other words, your filters will remove the bandwidths 59 - 61 Hz (aka 60 Hz +/- 1), 118 - 122 Hz (aka 120 Hz +/- 2), 178 - 182 Hz (aka 180 Hz +/- 2) respectively. Based on these configurations, the bottom of the panel will automatically display a summary of how many filters you have and the bandwidths each will remove. Click the blue Apply Notch Filters button to apply the filters to your data. Inspection: Controls settings of the notch Use the block and electrode drop down menus to select the data you wish to view in the Notch: Inspect Signals panel located on the right half of the screen. You can use the “previous” and “next” buttons to easily switch between which electrode data you’re viewing. recording session and electrode within that session Click previous or next to , then proceed +- Window length refers to +- Frequency limit refers to +- Number of histogram bins refers to Notch: Inspect Signals: Displays *raw and filtered iEEG signals for each channel whose data was imported Step #3: Wavelet Wavelet transform Step #4: Reference Signals Common average referencing 5.2 Part Two Surface Registration Localization 5.3 Part Three Generate Epoch "]]
