Step 1.1: Select project &amp; subject First, use the drop down menu to specify which project you want the cleaned subject data to be stored in. If you wish to create a new project, select “New Project” from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the rave_data folder of the data directory (data_dir), in a new folder for your subject. Next, use the drop down menu to select the code for the subject whose data you want to import. Note that a subject’s data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within therave_data folder. Click the “Create Subject” button to proceed to the next step. Step 1.2: Format &amp; session blocks RAVE defines a block/session as a period of continuous electrode recording. Here, you should first select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. Note that when you select a block, a preview of the files it contains will pop-up to the right. This feature helps you check that the way you’ve stored your data is consistent with the file type you’ve selected. Then, specify the file format your iEEG data is stored in. RAVE currently supports four file formats: .mat/.h5 file per electrode per block single .mat/.h5 file per block single EDF(+) file per block single BrainVision file Note that when you select a format from the drop down, a brief description of the specific format will pop-up underneath the menu. For more information on these file types, visit the Q&amp;A at Importing Data Step 1.3: Channel information RAVE equates a channel to an electrode. Set the following specifications for your channels: Data file: Channel numbers: Indicate the electrodes you wish to analyze. It is recommended that you run the preprocessing steps on all electrodes at once. Note that RAVE can automatically detect potential electrodes based on the specified blocks and file type; this suggestion is displayed at the bottom of the panel. Physical unit: Indicate the units you wish to use to measure voltage. Sample rate: Indicate the rate of your iEEG recording equipment; this value will determine the rate at which the preprocessing will be run. Now, select the Validate &amp; Import button to validate your data. A pop-up will soon appear asking if you are ready to import your data. Please double check all the information you entered is correct, and then select the Import Data button to proceed. You will see a progress bar in the bottom left corner. A pop-up will soon appear indicating that you have successfully imported your subject data into RAVE! You can now use the menu on the left side of the screen to select the first preprocessing module, notch filter. Step #2: Notch Filter What is a notch filter? A notch filter blocks a given frequency or a narrow range of frequencies (aka a “bandwidth”) from a signal without affecting the rest of that signal. It is often used to minimize line noise interference in raw iEEG data, which helps ensure that future analyses only consider actual brain data. A common source of this interference is the amplifier used in recording set-ups to convert electrode signals into a form readable by the computer. This interference is commonly introduced at 60 Hz, since that is the standard frequency used in the North American electrical grid system. To apply the notch filter, RAVE performs a fast fourier transform (FFT) of the signal. To learn more about FFT, visit the Q&amp;A section at Notch Filter. To apply the notch filter to your data, follow the steps below. Begin in the Data Selection window to specify which data you want to perform the notch filter on . Use the drop down to indicate the desired project and subject. Note that you can press the Sync from [Import LFP] module link to automatically select the project and subject that you just imported in the Import Signals module. Proceed by selecting the Load Subject button. A new screen will load with three panels: Filter Settings, Inspection, and Notch. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. Sample Notch Filter Screen Filter Settings: Begin my indicating your desired configurations for the filter(s). Base frequency refers to the frequency introduced by the amplifier that you want to remove. By default, this is set as 60 Hz as that is the frequency introduced by most iEEG amplifiers. x Times sets the multipliers of the base frequency you want removed by the filter. This feature allows you to account for harmonics (waves with frequencies that are positive integer multiples of the base frequency), which result because the signal from the amplifier is not a pure sine wave when undergoing FFT analysis. By default, this value is set as “1,2,3” based on the harmonics that commonly result in iEEG recording set-ups. This default means that 60 Hz (base frequency * 1), 120 Hz (base frequency * 2), 180 Hz (base frequency * 3) are the frequencies that the notch filter will remove. +- Bandwidth (Hz) refers to how wide you wish to make each filter; a higher number will remove a wider range of frequencies whereas a lower number will remove a narrower range of frequencies. You should enter one number for each filter you have. By default, this value is set to 1,2,2 – in other words, your filters will remove the bandwidths 59 - 61 Hz (aka 60 Hz +/- 1), 118 - 122 Hz (aka 120 Hz +/- 2), 178 - 182 Hz (aka 180 Hz +/- 2) respectively. Based on these configurations, the bottom of the panel will automatically display a summary of how many filters you have and the bandwidths each will remove. Click the blue Apply Notch Filters button to apply the filters to your data. A pop-up will appear showing a summary of your configurations. Click “Confirm” to proceed. Inspection: Controls settings of the figures displayed in the Notch: Inspect Signals panel located to the right. Use the block and electrode drop down menus to select the data you wish to display in the Notch: Inspect Signals panel. You can use the previous and next buttons to easily switch between which electrode you’re viewing within a selected recording session. The window length slider controls the power range displayed for the Welch periodograms. The more you move the slider to the right, the wider the dB range on the y-axis. The frequency limit slider controls the frequency range for the Welch periodograms. The more you move the slider to the right, the higher the frequencies that will be displayed on the x-axis. The number of histogram bins slider controls how wide the voltage ranges on the horizontal axis of the histogram are, where each bin represents a vertical bar on the graph. Choosing a larger number will create narrower voltage ranges and thus more vertical bars, whereas choosing a smaller number will create wider voltage ranges and thus fewer vertical bars. Moving the slider can give you a more precise look at which voltages are most represented in the electrode signal. Notch: Inspect Signals: Displays *raw and filtered iEEG signals for each channel whose data was imported The top Local Field Potential Graph plots voltage versus time in seconds to show the raw signal that was recorded from the selected electrode. The red lines on the graph reflect the normalization The leftmost Welch Periodogram estimates the power of the signal at its component frequencies. Before applying the notch filter, only the original graph will be shown in grey. After you’ve applied the notch filter, the filtered signal will be shown in red; you should visibly see the power of the signal reduced at the base and harmonic frequencies. To learn more about the calculation of the Welch Periodogram, visit the Q&amp;A at Notch Filter. The center Welch Periodogram is the same as the leftmost periodogram, except it is transformed to have a logarithmic x-axis. This graph makes viewing the signals at lower frequencies easier. The Histogram Original plots frequency on the vertical axis and voltage on the horizontal axis to depict how often each range of voltages occurs in the signal. If you wish to download these figures, simply click the Download as PDF link at the bottom of the Inspection panel. This will generate a PDF file in a new tab with a slide for each electrode within each block. Step #3: Wavelet Once you click the wavelet tab on the left menu, a data selection window will appear for you to select the project and subject whose data you wish to apply wavelet decomposition to. You can once again click the “sync from [import LFP] module” to automatically select the subject you just imported. Note: You must have applied the notch filter to your selected subject before trying to apply the wavelet transformation. After selecting the “Load Subject” button, a new screen will load with two panels: Wavelet Settings and Wavelet Kernel. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. Sample Wavelet Decomposition Screen Wavelet decomposition is a type of time frequency analysis that is used for non-stationary signals (i.e. properties change over time), like that of iEEG. It separates the signal into differing frequency and phase components, which is helpful because signals in the brain are very dynamic. Thus, wavelet In this module, RAVE will: - down sample the signal before running the wavelet, if desired - run a wavelet on each block in the selected subject’s folder - down sample the wavelet coefficients to 100.0 Hz to reduce the amount of space needed to save the information onto your computer’s disk Wavelet Settings: Begin by setting the basic configurations: The Power sample rate The Down-sample before wavelet drop down menu will allow you to select a factor of 1, 2, 4, or 8 to use If you wish to reduce the amount of time it takes to run the wavelet, please select the use single float precision checkbox. Please note, though, that this option will also _____. Proceed by setting your frequency and cycle configurations: The select method to generate wavelet parameters The frequency range The frequency step size The wavelet cycles Wavelet Kernel: The Wavelet Kernels (Real &amp; Imaginary) graph The Wavelet Length | Frequency The Wavelet Cycle | Frequency If you wish to download the kernel parameters, click the blue download kernel parameters link at the bottom of the window. This will generate a csv file with each frequency and its corresponding number of cycles. When finished setting the configurations and reviewing the figures, select the blue Run Wavelet button. As shown below, a pop-up will appear on the screen asking you to confirm the subject, frequencies, # of cycles, and precision that you selected for the wavelet transformation. Click “confirm” to proceed, or “confirm and run in background” if you wish to continue using RAVE during the decomposition process. Note that this process can take up to 30 minutes; progress bars for each task will be displayed in the lower right corner. Sample Wavelet Decomposition Confirmation Window The process is completed if a “success” pop-up appears. You can now proceed to the next module, referencing!
