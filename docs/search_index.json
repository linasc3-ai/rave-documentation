Step 1.1: Select project &amp; subject First, use the drop down menu to specify which project you want the cleaned subject data to be stored in. If you wish to create a new project, select “New Project” from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the rave_data folder of the data directory (data_dir), in a new folder for your subject. Next, use the drop down menu to select the code for the subject whose data you want to import. Note that a subject’s data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within therave_data folder. Click the “Create Subject” button to proceed to the next step. Step 1.2: Format &amp; session blocks RAVE defines a block/session as a period of continuous electrode recording. Here, you should first select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. Note that when you select a block, a preview of the files it contains will pop-up to the right. This feature helps you check that the way you’ve stored your data is consistent with the file type you’ve selected. Then, specify the file format your iEEG data is stored in. RAVE currently supports four file formats: .mat/.h5 file per electrode per block single .mat/.h5 file per block single EDF(+) file per block single BrainVision file Note that when you select a format from the drop down, a brief description of the specific format will pop-up underneath the menu.
