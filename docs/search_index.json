By default, RAVE already has a DemoSubject whose raw data has already been imported. You can also download other demo subjects by copying and pasting the following command into the RStudio console: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;subject_code&quot;) You will need to substitute “subject_code” with one of the available demo subjects: KC, YAB, YAD, YAF, YAH, YAI, YAJ, and YAK. For example, to download subject YAB, use the following command: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAB&quot;) Note that downloaded demo data will be stored in the raw_dir folder of the rave_data folder in your home directory. Within raw_dir, each subject’s data is stored in its own folder (e.g. YAB’s data will be stored in the YAB folder in raw_dir). Refer to the following screenshot for clarity. Screenshot of location of downloaded demo data You can proceed to the “importing demo data” instructions to load this raw data into RAVE for cleaning (? double check). 4.2 Importing data To launch the RAVE Preprocessing module, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: rave::rave_preprocess() The Preprocessing module will then open in a browser window, allowing you to see the Overview page. The Overview page allows you to import raw iEEG data into RAVE for cleaning and consists of three panels. * Overview: * Information: * Import Widgets: 4.2.1 Step 1: Select Subject Enter the code for the demo subject whose iEEG data you want to import into RAVE. Note that a subject’s data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within rave_data. E.g. if you want to select demo subject KC, enter “KC” and you should receive the following message letting you know the subject has been found: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/raw_dir/KC (found!) 4.2.2 Step 2: Select Project or Create New One This step allows you to specify where you want the cleaned data to be stored. If you wish to create a new project, select “New Project” from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the data directory (data_dir) within rave_data, with a new folder for the subject. E.g. if you wish to store demo subject KC in a new project called “Test”, you should receive the following message: Subject [Test/KC] will be stored at: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/data_dir/Test/KC Then, click “create subject” to proceed. // mention built-in demo folder 4.2.3 Step 3: Validate Data In this step, you will have to specify your desired channel options: * Folders: Each folder corresponds to a block, aka a period or session of continuous electrode recording (#importing-data). * Electrodes: * Sample Rate: * Physical Unit: * File Format: // how to do they know what to put in for a demo subject Refer to the following screenshot for clarity.
