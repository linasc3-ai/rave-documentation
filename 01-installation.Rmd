# Installation Guide

Installing RAVE involves two parts: 
1). installing the pre-requisites
2). downloading RAVE

Carefully follow the steps below to install RAVE: 

**Note:** For optimal use of RAVE, it is recommended your computer has at least 64GB RAM and a 4-core CPU. 

---

## Install the Prerequisites
Because RAVE is written in the programming language "R", it is necessary to download R and its integrated development editor "RStudio" onto your computer. Correctly installing the following pre-requisites is necessary for RAVE to work properly. 

**Note:** RAVE requires the latest versions of R and RStudio to run properly. To avoid errors in the download process, if you already have R and RStudio on your computer, be sure they are updated to the most recent versions. 

<!--- ### Windows

### Linux -->

### MacOS

#### Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager that adds functions missing from the Apple operating system. It can be installed by copying and pasting the following line into your terminal (**note:** the terminal can be found through searching the applications folder on your computer): 

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If you have not downloaded Homebrew to your computer before, you will be prompted with the following questions: 

```
==> Checking for `sudo` access (which may request your password)...
Password:
```

**Enter your user password.** Note that the password won't be displayed into the screen as you type for security reasons. Once you've finish typing, press the RETURN or ENTER key to proceed. 

```
==> This script will install:
... 
Press RETURN/ENTER to continue or any other key to abort:
```
Please press the RETURN or ENTER key to continue. 

##### Add brew to path {-}
The terminal commands used to add homebrew to the path depend on your computer's CPU chip. Copy and paste the appropriate command lines into the terminal based on your computer's chip type. 

* **For M1 Chips** 
```sh
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

* **For Intel Chips** 


#### Install R Language 
Download and install the latest version of R directly from the website: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ Be sure to download the package that corresponds to your computer's OS version and CPU type. 

* For Intel Macs, download `R-X.X.X.pkg` 
* For M1 Macs, download `R-X.X.X-arm64.pkg` 

#### Install RStudio Desktop 
Download and install RStudio Desktop directly from the website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Be sure to download the version that corresponds to your OS system. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance.

#### Install system libraries
You will need to download the libraries hdf5, fftw, and pkg-config. This can be done by copying and pasting the following line into your terminal: 

```sh
brew install hdf5 fftw pkg-config
```

#### Troubleshooting
Possible errors and their recommended fixes: 

* If you have multiple accounts on your computer but only one of them has homebrew installed, you may receive a **"the following directories are not writable by your user" error**. To resolve this error, you can change the ownership of the directories to the current user and make sure this user has write permission. 
* When executing step 2.1.1.4 (installing hdf5, fftw, and pkg-config), if you receive the error **"No available formula with the name "hdf5".**, there might bee an issue with the location of Homebrew. Try the following commands in your terminal: 

```sh
rm -rf "/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core"
```
and then 
```sh
brew tap homebrew/core
```

## Install RAVE

Now that you have installed the pre-requisites, follow the steps below to download and install the RAVE package on your computer. 

### Download and Configure

Open the RStudio application and click on the *Console* tab (if RStudio is set to default settings, this tab is usually located in bottom left panel of your screen). 

Copy and paste the following command onto the console to **download the RAVE packages from the online repository and install them** on your computer: 

```r
options(repos = c(ropensci = 'https://beauchamplab.r-universe.dev', 
                  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
install.packages(c('rave', 'ravebuiltins'))
```

Copy and paste the following command onto the console to **update RAVE to the latest available version** (this will account for recent bug fixes and newly added features): 

```r
rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE)
```

Copy and paste the following command onto the console to: 
* **Download template brain** (`N27`, `fsaverage`) for electrode template mapping
* **Download demo subject data** for single- and group-level analyses

```r
rave::finalize_installation(upgrade = 'ask')
```

#### Troubleshooting
* When updating RAVE, if you receive a "timeout of 60 seconds was reached" warning message, try switching to a faster network connection.

### Validate the Installation

To check whether RAVE was properly installed, copy and paste the following commands
onto the console to start the program: 

```r
 rave::start_rave()
```

If installation was successful, a new web browser window should automatically open with the 
RAVE display. A screenshot is shown below: 

![RAVE Start Screen](static/image/RAVEStartScreen.png) 

You have successfully downloaded RAVE! 

#### Troubleshooting 
** The RAVE data should be located [default location]. If located elsewhere on the window, copy and paste the following command onto the console to set the data directory to the correct location: 
```r
 rave::rave_options()
```

--- 

## Updating RAVE after download
If you've already downloaded RAVE and simply wish to update the application to the most recent version, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: 

```r
 rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE)
```

**Note:** When re-updating, a pop-up might appear in RStudio asking if you want to reinstall the N27 template brain. Because the template is already installed, click no.
