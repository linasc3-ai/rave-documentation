# Installation Guide

Installing RAVE involves two parts: 
1). installing the pre-requisites
2). downloading RAVE

Carefully follow the steps below to install RAVE: 

**Note:** For optimal use of RAVE, it is recommended your computer has at least 64GB RAM and a 4-core CPU. 

---

## Install the Prerequisites
Because RAVE is written in the programming language "R", it is necessary to download R and its integrated development editor "RStudio" onto your computer. Correctly installing the following pre-requisites is necessary for RAVE to work properly. 

**Note:** RAVE requires the latest versions of R and RStudio to run properly. To avoid errors in the download process, if you already have R and RStudio on your computer, be sure they are updated to the most recently released versions.

#### Install Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager that adds functions missing from the Apple operating system. It can be installed by copying and pasting the following line into your terminal (**note:** the terminal can be found through searching the applications folder on your computer): 

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If you have not downloaded Homebrew to your computer before, you will be prompted with the following questions: 

```

... 
Press RETURN/ENTER to continue or any other key to abort:
```
Please press the RETURN or ENTER key to continue. 

##### Add brew to path {-}
The terminal commands used to add homebrew to the path depend on your computer's CPU chip. Copy and paste the appropriate command lines based on your computer's chip type. 

**For M1 Chips** 
```sh
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

**For Intel Chips** 


#### Install R Language 
Download the latest version of R directly from the website: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ Be sure to download the package that corresponds to your computer's OS version and CPU type. 

* For Intel Macs, download `R-X.X.X.pkg` 
* For M1 Macs, download `R-X.X.X-arm64.pkg` 

#### Install RStudio Desktop 
You can install RStudio Desktop by directly downloading from the website. Visit the following link to download the application: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Be sure to download the version that corresponds to your OS system. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance.

#### Install system libraries
You will need to download the libraries hdf5, fftw, and pkg-config. This can be done by copying and pasting the following line into your terminal: 

```sh
brew install hdf5 fftw pkg-config
```

#### Troubleshooting
Possible errors and their recommended fixes: 

* If you have multiple accounts on your computer but only one of them has homebrew installed, you may receive a **"the following directories are not writable by your user" error**. To resolve this error, you can change the ownership of the directories to the current user and make sure this user has write permission. 
* When executing step 2.1.1.4 (installing hdf5, fftw, and pkg-config), if you receive the error **"No available formula with the name "hdf5".**, there might bee an issue with the location of Homebrew. Try the following commands in your terminal: 

```sh
rm -rf "/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core"
```
and then 
```sh
brew tap homebrew/core
```

## Install RAVE
Now that you have installed the pre-requisites, the following steps will walk you through the process of downloading and installing the RAVE application on your computer. 

### Download RAVE packages
Open the RStudio application and click on the Console tab located in bottom left panel of your screen. Copy and paste the following command onto the console to download the RAVE packages from the online repository: 

```sh
options(repos = c(ropensci = 'https://beauchamplab.r-universe.dev', CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

### Install RAVE packages on RStudio 
Copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console to install RAVE and its built-in modules onto your computer. 

```sh
install.packages(c('rave', 'ravebuiltins'))
```

Please note that this process can take some time.

### Update RAVE to most recent version
Copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console to update RAVE and its dependencies to the most recent version. 

```sh
 rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE)
```

### Download and install templates and demo subject data
Copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console to download template and demo subject data. This will allow you to try out RAVE's features with sample data! 

```sh
 rave::finalize_installation(upgrade = 'ask')
```

You have successfully downloaded RAVE! 

### Troubleshooting
* When updating RAVE, if you receive a "timeout of 60 seconds was reached" warning message, try switching to a faster network connection.

## Updating RAVE after initial download
If you've already downloaded RAVE and simply wish to update the application to the most recent version, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: 

```sh
 rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE)
```

**Note:** You must stop processes that are currently being executed by the console before trying to initiate another command. To do this, click the red stop sign on the bottom left panel of RStudio. For example, if you have just opened RAVE and wish to update the application, click the red stop sign. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. 

**Note:** When re-updating, a pop-up might appear in RStudio asking if you want to reinstall the N27 template brain. As the template is already installed, you can click no.
