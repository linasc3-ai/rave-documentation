```sh
 rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE)
```

### Download and install templates and demo subject data
Copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console to download template and demo subject data. This will allow you to try out RAVE's features with sample data!

## Starting RAVE 
*Note:* you must quit and restart RStudio if you have just downloaded or updated RAVE in order for the application to start successfully.

After restarting RStudio, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console to open RAVE:

## Updating RAVE
If you've already downloaded RAVE and simply wish to update the application to the most recent version, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: 

```sh
 rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE)
```

**Note:** You must stop processes that are currently being executed by the console before trying to initiate another command. To do this, click the red stop sign on the bottom left panel of RStudio. For example, if you have just opened RAVE and wish to update the application, click the red stop sign. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. 

**Note:** When re-updating, a pop-up might appear in RStudio asking if you want to reinstall the N27 template brain. As the template is already installed, you can click no.
