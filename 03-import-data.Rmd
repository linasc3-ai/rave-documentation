# Preprocessing: Import Data

Now that you have installed RAVE and understand how to start/close the program, you can proceed to importing your iEEG data into RAVE so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules.

## Downloading demo data 

Before importing your own data, you may wish to gain familiarity by trying RAVE's demo data in various modules. By default, RAVE already has a DemoSubject whose raw data has already been imported. You can also download other demo subjects by copying and pasting the following command into the RStudio console: 

```r
rave::download_sample_data("subject_code")
```

You will need to substitute "subject_code" with one of the available demo subjects: `KC`, `YAB`, `YAD`, `YAF`, `YAH`, `YAI`, `YAJ`, and `YAK`. 

For example, to download subject YAB, use the following command: 
```r
rave::download_sample_data("YAB")
```

Note that downloaded demo data will be stored in the `raw_dir` folder of the `rave_data` folder in your home directory. Within `raw_dir`, each subject's data is stored in its own folder (e.g. YAB's data will be stored in the YAB folder in `raw_dir`). Refer to the following screenshot for clarity.

You can proceed to the "importing demo data" instructions to load this raw data into RAVE for cleaning (? double check). 
 
## Importing data

To launch the RAVE Preprocessing module, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: 

```r 
 rave::rave_preprocess()
```

The Preprocessing module will then open in a browser window, allowing you to see the Overview page. The Overview page allows you to import raw iEEG data into RAVE for cleaning and consists of three panels.
