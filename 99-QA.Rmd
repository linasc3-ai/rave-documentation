# Q&As

--- 

This page contains possible questions that may arise when using RAVE and their answers. Questions are organized by section. 

## Installation
<!-- note: these are sourced from the troubleshooting section of my documentation, not sure if they're better placed here or in those troubleshooting sections --> 

> **Question:** When updating RAVE, I received a “timeout of 60 seconds was reached” warning message. How do I fix this? 

Answer: Try switching to a faster network connection. 

> **Question:** I already have R and RStudio downloaded. Can I skip the prerequisites? 

Answer: RAVE is dependent on the most recent versions of these applications, so please make sure they are properly updated. Be sure to also review the other pre-requisite steps, like installing Homebrew and the system libraries. The most common reason for issues in the installation of RAVE is failure to properly download these prerequisites. 

> **Question:** How can I check my computer's OS version or CPU type? 

Answer: If you're using a Mac, this can be found by clicking the apple logo at the top left of your screen, and then clicking "About this Mac". The version and processor (CPU type) will be listed there. 

> **Question:** I received a “the following directories are not writable by your user” error. How do I fix this? 

Answer: If you have multiple accounts on your computer but only one of them has homebrew installed, you may receive that error. To resolve it, you can change the ownership of the directories to the current user and make sure this user has write permission.

## Getting Started with RAVE

**Question**: I copied a command into the RStudio console, but nothing is happening. What is the issue? 

Make sure you click the red stop sign at the top right of the console to stop the current command. This is necessary if you want to execute a different command. 

## Downloading Demo Data 

> **Question:** I received this message when trying to import a demo subject. 

/Users/aliavyanne/rave_data/raw_dir/YAI (NOT found) /Users/aliavyanne/rave_data/bids_dir//Test/sub-YAI (NOT found)

How do I fix this? 

Answer: You forgot to download this demo subject before importing them. You can use the following command to download the demo subject YAI: 

```r
rave::download_sample_data("YAI")
```

> **Question:** Where does the demo data come from? 
Answer: The demo data available in RAVE is sourced from experiments run by the Beauchamp Lab at the Perelman School of Medicine, which investigates the neural mechanisms for multisensory integration and visual perception in human subjects. Read more at: https://www.med.upenn.edu/beauchamplab/

## Importing Data

> **Question:** What does the term "channel" refer to? 
Answer: In the early design of RAVE, we focused on exploring one channel per electrode cases, hence we equivalent "channel" to "electrode" here. 

> **Question:** In step 3, why are the "folders" and "electrode" fields designated as "read-only"?

Answer: If these fields are designated as "read only," this means you have already imported the entered subject. To preserve reproducibility, once raw data for a subject is imported and notch filtered, you can not change the channel options. 

> **Question:** In step 3, what does the term "block" refer to? 

Answer: RAVE defines "block" as a period or session of continuous recording. A block should be named with a zero-padded integer according to the order they were recorded (e.g. 001 for the first session, 002 for the second). 

> **Question:** On the import widgets panel at bottom right, I got a message that electrode files are missing. How do I resolve this? 

Answer: When you hit the "check subject" button, the bottom right panel will let you know if any electrode files are missing based on the electrode numbers you entered in step three. Be sure to double check that you indicated the correct electrode numbers in step 3.

> **Question:** Does RAVE automatically validate my data? 

Answer: You should check for yourself to make sure that each block contains the appropriate files. RAVE will not automatically check this for you. 

> **Question:** How do I know which file format to select in step 3? 

Answer: When you select a file format from the drop down, RAVE will display brief information on what that format entails and a sample organization for the data directory. Select the format that matches that of your data. 

> **Question:** Where are my inputs and configurations stored for a given subject? 

Answer: This information is stored within `data_dir/<project>/subject>/rave/preprocess/rave.yaml` of your home directory. 

## Notch Filter

> **Question:** What is fast fourier transform (FFT)? 

Answer: FFT is an algorithm that can quickly compute the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a signal. It transforms the signal from a function of time to the a fucntion of frequency by dividing the signal into its frequency components. Each component constitutes an oscillation with a unique amplitude. This procedure makes it easier to extract a base frequency and its harmonics (e.g. of the amplifier) to perform the notch filter.

> **Question:** What is a Welch Periodogram? 

Answer: The Welch method allows for the estimation of the power of a signal at its component frequencies. The time signal is separated into individual blocks, a periodogram is created for each block, and then these periodograms are averaged to estimate the power. The Welch method reduces noise in the power estimation compared to other methods. (Note: a periodogram identifies the dominant frequencies in a time signal.)

> **Question:** How can I switch between subjects while on the notch filter or wavelet modules? 

Answer: In the bottom right corner of the screen, there is a rectangular button that lists the project and subject you're currently analyzing -- e.g. "demo/YAD". Click that button to go back to the load data screen and select a different project and/or subject. 

> **Question:** I've already performed the notch filter, but RAVE is not letting me update my channel options. How can I fix this? 

Answer: Once the data is imported and notch filtered, you cannot change the channel options. You should make a new project to change the channel options in this case.

> **Question:** This error popped up when I tried loading a subject into the notch filter module. What do I do? "Found an error while loading the power data: The subject exists but its signal has not been imported yet." 

Answer: Use the menu at left to go back to the "import signals" module. You will need to import that subject using the "validate & import" button. 


## Wavelet

> **Question:** What does wavelet transformation actually entail? 

Answer: A complex wavelet will undergo convulotion with the iEEG signal. The iEEG signal will then be translated across the time axis, using either high frequency or low frequency wavelets. The result is good frequency resolution but poor temporal resolution at low frequencies, and good temporal resolution and poor frequency resolution at high frequencies. Note that a wavelet is created by multiplying a Gaussian function with a sine function. See more: https://sapienlabs.org/lab-talk/time-frequency-analysis-and-wavelets/v

**Question::** Why can't I down-sample the wavelet coefficients to a sample rate less than or equal to 1?
