## Installation

We use the following command to get `YAB` data. 
```r
rave::download_sample_data("YAB")
```
Does this download the data into the `<raw_dir>` folder? Can I substitute "YAB" for "KC" as well because these all constitute the demo data available in RAVE? 

> Answer: Yes, the raw data are included and will be downloaded into raw directories by default. You can replace `"YAB"` with `"KC"` and other demo subjects. The available demo subjects are `KC`, `YAB`, `YAD`, `YAF`, `YAH`, `YAI`, `YAJ`, and `YAK`.
