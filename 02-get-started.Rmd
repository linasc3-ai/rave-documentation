# Get Started

<!--- [click](#install-the-prerequisites) --> 

Now that you've successfully installed RAVE, review the following instructions to get started using the tool.  

## Starting RAVE

*Note:* you must quit and restart RStudio if you have just downloaded or updated RAVE in order for the application to start successfully.

After restarting RStudio, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console to open RAVE: 

```sh
 rave::start_rave()
```

RAVE will display in a new web browser (Google Chrome is recommended for optimal use). 

## Closing RAVE 
To completely close the RAVE server: 
1). Click the red stop sign in the bottom left panel of RStudio.
2). Quit the RStudio application. If asked whether you want to **Save workspace image?**, click no.  

**Note:** Closing the RAVE display tab on your web browser will only close the display, not the actual RAVE server.
