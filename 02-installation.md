# Installation Guide

RAVE is written as an "R" package. To properly install RAVE, please carefully follow the instructions step-by-step. We found 90% installation issues are due to not following the instructions (for example, [system prerequisites](#system-prerequisites)).

<span class="underline">
Hardware Requirements
</span>

* Minimal requirement: 4 CPU cores with 8 GB RAM
* Recommended: 8+ CPU with 32+ GB RAM

<span class="underline">
System Library Prerequisites
</span>

* [MacOS](#macos)
* Windows
* Debian Linux (Ubuntu)

## System Prerequisites

RAVE is written in the programming language "R", so it is necessary to download the *latest* version of R for your computer. We also strongly recommend installing "RStudio", an integrated development environment, in order to easily utilize RAVE features. This section will guide you to install these and other prerequisites. Please click on the following links according to your operating systems.

* [MacOS](#macos)
* Windows
* Debian Linux (Ubuntu)

<!-- and its integrated development editor "RStudio" onto your computer. Correctly installing the following pre-requisites is necessary for RAVE to work properly. 

**Note:** RAVE requires the latest versions of R and RStudio to run properly. To avoid errors in the download process, if you already have R and RStudio on your computer, be sure they are updated to the most recent versions. -->

_(Note: if you have downloaded **Homebrew** in the past, please skip Step 1 and 2 and jump to the [Step 3](#step-3-use-brew-to-install-missing-libraries).)_

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager that adds system libraries missing from the Apple operating system. It can be installed by copying and pasting the following line into your terminal (**note:** the terminal can be found through searching the applications folder on your computer): 

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

If this is the first time that you install the Homebrew, the following questions might be prompted:

```
==> Checking for `sudo` access (which may request your password)...
Password:
```

Enter your user's password (*the password won't be displayed into the screen as you type for security reasons*). Once you've finish typing, press the `RETURN` or `ENTER` key to proceed. 

```
==> This script will install:
... 
Press RETURN/ENTER to continue or any other key to abort:
```

Please press the `RETURN` or `ENTER` key to continue. 

<span class="font-5 underline strong">[STEP 2: Add command "brew" to system search path]</span>

The terminal commands used to add homebrew to the path depend on your computer's CPU chip. Copy and paste the appropriate command lines into the terminal based on your computer's chip type. If you don't know the CPU type, click the `ï£¿` icon on the top-right, and choose `About This Mac`.

* **For M1 Chips** 
```sh
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
 echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

* **For Intel Chips** 

```sh
 echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
 echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.profile
 echo 'eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
```

<span id="step-3-use-brew-to-install-missing-libraries" class="font-5 underline strong">[STEP 3: Use brew to install missing libraries]</span>

Open the system terminal, paste the following line and press `return` key:

```sh
brew install hdf5 fftw pkg-config
```

This command installs the following three libraries:

* `hdf5`: Shared library to access the universal HDF5 file format
* `fftw`: Fast-Fourier transform library required by signal processing code
* `pkg-config`: Package configuration helpers allowing R to find the two libraries above

<span class="font-5 underline strong">[STEP 4: Install R]</span>

Download and install the **latest** version of R directly from the website: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ Be sure to download the package that corresponds to your computer's OS version and CPU type. If R has been installed, we highly recommend that you update to the latest version.  

* For Intel Macs, the R installer name should look like `R-X.X.X.pkg` 
* For M1 Macs, the R installer name should look like `R-X.X.X-arm64.pkg` 

<span class="font-5 underline strong">[STEP 5: Install RStudio Desktop]</span>

Download and install RStudio Desktop directly from the website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ Be sure to download the version that corresponds to your OS system. If you already have RStudio downloaded, simply ensure it is updated to the *latest* version. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance.

## Install RAVE

> Important: Before proceeding to rest of this section. Please make sure you have read and finished the previous section: "[System prerequisites](#system-prerequisites)".

**Download and Configure**

Open the RStudio application and click on the *Console* tab. If your RStudio adopts the default settings, this tab should be located in bottom-left. 

> Important: Please do NOT mix an R command with a shell command. When running R command, please open `RStudio` and use the `Console` tab to run. If you direct copy the R scripts into system shell terminals, the script will fail!

Copy and paste the following R command into the RStudio console to install RAVE and its dependence from online repositories: 

```r
options(repos = c(ropensci = 'https://beauchamplab.r-universe.dev', 
                  CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
install.packages(c('rave', 'ravebuiltins', 'ravedash'))
```

Copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console to update RAVE to the latest version (with bug fixes and new features):

```r
rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE)
```

Execute the following R command to download extra data and templates:


```r
rave::finalize_installation(upgrade = 'always')
```

This finalizing step will download the following additional parts:

* Template brain: (`N27`, `fsaverage`) for group-level electrode template mapping
* Demo subject data: for demonstration purposes
* Built-in modules and pipelines

<!--#### Troubleshooting
* When updating RAVE, if you receive a "timeout of 60 seconds was reached" warning message, try switching to a faster network connection.-->

**Validate the Installation**

To check whether RAVE has been properly installed, execute the following R command
to start the program. 

```r
rave::start_rave()
```

If installation was successful, a new web browser window should automatically open with the 
RAVE display. A screenshot is shown below: 

![RAVE Start Screen](static/image/RAVEStartScreen.png) 

ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully downloaded RAVE! 

Now that you've completed installation, visit the following pages to start using RAVE! 

* [Starting RAVE](#starting-rave)
* [Upgrade RAVE](#upgrade-rave)
* [Change RAVE settings](#change-rave-settings) 

## Upgrade RAVE

RAVE is actively under development with new features and bug fixes. To enjoy the new features, RAVE has built-in function that allows to update itself directly from the following R command:

```r
 rave::check_dependencies(nightly = TRUE)
```

**Note:** When re-updating, a pop-up might appear asking if you want to re-install the N27 template brain or pipeline modules. Simply choose "yes".


## Troubleshooting 
Possible errors during installation and their solutions: 

**Error:** "The following directories are not writable by your user". 
> Solution: This could occur if you have multiple accountns on your computer, but only one of them has homebrew installed. You should change the ownership of the directories to the current user and make sure this user has write permission. 

**Error:** "Can't update lock in /usr/local/var/homebrew/locks". 
> Solution: This could occur if you have multiple accountns on your computer, but only one of them has homebrew installed. You can fix permissions by running -R $(whoami) /usr/local/var/homebrew. 

**Error:** "No available formula with the name 'hdf5'". 
> Solution: There might be an issue with the location of Homebrew. Please ensure you copied and pasted the commands in"STEP 2: Add command brew to system search path". If you've already done that, you can try copying and pasting the following command into your console: 

```sh
rm -rf "/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core"
```
and then 
```sh
brew tap homebrew/core
```
<!-- 
** The RAVE data should be located [default location]. If located elsewhere on the window, copy and paste the following command onto the console to set the data directory to the correct location: 
```r
 rave::rave_options()
```
-->
