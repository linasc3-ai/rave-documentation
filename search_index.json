System: Allows you to change RAM and number of CPU cores RAVE can use to alter speed at which data is read 3D Viewer: Allows you to change which downloaded brain data to use as the template brain for electrode template mapping; the default template brain is N27. Note: In general, you must stop processes that are currently being executed by the console before trying to initiate another command. To do this, click the red stop sign on the bottom left panel of RStudio. For example, if you have just opened RAVE and wish to update the application, click the red stop sign. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. "],["preprocessing-import-data.html", "Chapter 4 Preprocessing: Import Data 4.1 Downloading demo data 4.2 Importing data", " Chapter 4 Preprocessing: Import Data Now that you have installed RAVE and understand how to start/close the program, you can proceed to importing your iEEG data into RAVE so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules. 4.1 Downloading demo data Before importing your own data, you may wish to gain familiarity by trying RAVE’s demo data in various modules. By default, RAVE already has a DemoSubject whose raw data has already been imported. You can also download other demo subjects by copying and pasting the following command into the RStudio console: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;subject_code&quot;) You will need to substitute “subject_code” with one of the available demo subjects: KC, YAB, YAD, YAF, YAH, YAI, YAJ, and YAK. For example, to download subject YAB, use the following command: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAB&quot;) Note that downloaded demo data will be stored in the raw_dir folder of the rave_data folder in your home directory. Within raw_dir, each subject’s data is stored in its own folder (e.g. YAB’s data will be stored in the YAB folder in raw_dir). Refer to the following screenshot for clarity. Screenshot of location of downloaded demo data You can proceed to the “importing demo data” instructions to load this raw data into RAVE for cleaning (? double check). 4.2 Importing data To launch the RAVE Preprocessing module, copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: rave::rave_preprocess() The Preprocessing module will then open in a browser window, allowing you to see the Overview page. The Overview page allows you to import raw iEEG data into RAVE for cleaning and consists of three panels. * Overview: * Information: * Import Widgets: 4.2.1 Step 1: Select Subject Enter the code for the demo subject whose iEEG data you want to import into RAVE. Note that a subject’s data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within rave_data. E.g. if you want to select demo subject KC, enter “KC” and you should receive the following message letting you know the subject has been found: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/raw_dir/KC (found!) 4.2.2 Step 2: Select Project or Create New One This step allows you to specify where you want the cleaned data to be stored. If you wish to create a new project, select “New Project” from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the data directory (data_dir) within rave_data, with a new folder for the subject. E.g. if you wish to store demo subject KC in a new project called “Test”, you should receive the following message: Subject [Test/KC] will be stored at: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/data_dir/Test/KC Then, click “create subject” to proceed. 4.2.3 Step 3: Validate Data In this step, you will have to specify your desired channel options: Folders: Each folder corresponds to a block, aka a period or session of continuous electrode recording. Select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. (E.g. for KC, you could select blocks 003 and 004.) Electrodes: Indicate the electrodes you want to analyze. Note that it is reccomended that you run the preprocessing steps on all electrodes at once. (E.g. for KC, you should indicate 1-92.) !– // why is there a jump in labeling the electrode files (e.g. in KC, in block 004, the electrode values go from 1 to 92 but then there’s also 129 and 130?) –&gt; Sample Rate: Indicate the sample rate of your iEEG recording equipment; this value will determine the rate at which the preprocessing will be run. (E.g. for KC, you could indicate ‘2000’). Physical Unit: File Format: Click the Check Subject button to proceed. (Note: this process can take a few minutes; progress will be displayed via pop-ups in the bottom right.) Note: In the import widgets panel at bottom right, a message may pop-up informing you that electrode files are missing. Be sure to double check that you indicated the correct electrode numbers in step 3 and that each block contains the appropriate files. (?? should this be in the Q&amp;A instead) Click the Start Import button to proceed. (Note: this process can take a few minutes.) Refer to the following screenshot for clarity. // setting up the data properly "],["qas.html", "Chapter 5 Q&amp;As 5.1 Installation 5.2 Getting Started with RAVE 5.3 Downloading Demo Data 5.4 Importing Data", " Chapter 5 Q&amp;As This page contains possible questions that may arise when using RAVE and their answers. Questions are organized by section. 5.1 Installation 5.2 Getting Started with RAVE 5.3 Downloading Demo Data Question: We use the following command to get YAB data. rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAB&quot;) Does this download the data into the &lt;raw_dir&gt; folder? Can I substitute “YAB” for “KC” as well because these all constitute the demo data available in RAVE? Answer: Yes, the raw data are included and will be downloaded into raw directories by default. You can replace \"YAB\" with \"KC\" and other demo subjects. The available demo subjects are KC, YAB, YAD, YAF, YAH, YAI, YAJ, and YAK. // maybe change this question to “why does it say the demo subject data is not found” and answer is because you need to download the demo subject data first before importing 5.4 Importing Data Question: What does the term “channel” refer to? Question: In step 3, why are the “folders” and “electrode” fields designated as “read-only”? Answer: If these fields are designated as “read only,” this means you have already imported the entered subject. To preserve reproducibility, once raw data for a subject is imported and notch filtered, you can not change the channel options. Question: In step 3, what does the term “block” refer to? Answer: RAVE defines “block” as a period or session of continuous recording. A block should be named with a zero-padded integer according to the order they were recorded (e.g. 001 for the first session, 002 for the second). Question: How do I ensure my subject is validated? Answer: When you hit the “check subject” button, the bottom right panel will let you know if any electrode files are missing based on the electrode numbers you entered in step three. Also make to sure to check that the channels are correct. "]]
