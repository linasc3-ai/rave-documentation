"],["import-data.html", "Chapter 4 Import Data 4.1 Downloading demo data 4.2 Importing demo data 4.3 Importing Your Own Data", " Chapter 4 Import Data Now that you have installed and gotten started with RAVE, you can proceed to importing your iEEG data into the software so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules. 4.1 Downloading demo data Before importing your own data, you may wish to gain familiarity by trying RAVE‚Äôs demo data in various modules. By default, RAVE already has a DemoSubject whose raw data has already been imported. However, you can also download other demo subjects by copying and pasting the following command into the RStudio console: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;subject_code&quot;) You will need to substitute ‚Äúsubject_code‚Äù with one of the available demo subjects: KC, YAB, YAD, YAF, YAH, YAI, YAJ, and YAK. For example, to download subject YAB, use the following command: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAB&quot;) Note that downloaded demo data will be stored in the raw_dir folder of the rave_data folder in your home directory. Within raw_dir, each subject‚Äôs data is stored in its own folder (e.g.¬†YAB‚Äôs data will be stored in the YAB folder in raw_dir). Refer to the following screenshot for clarity. Screenshot of location of downloaded demo data You can proceed to the ‚Äúimporting demo data‚Äù instructions to load your newly downloaded raw data into RAVE for cleaning. 4.2 Importing demo data You will need to launch the RAVE preprocessing module. Copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: rave::rave_preprocess() The Preprocessing module will then open in a browser window, allowing you to see the Overview page. The Overview page is where you will import or load your data into RAVE. It consists of three panels. * Overview: this is where you will specify your inputs and configurations. * Information: a summary of your inputs and configurations is shown here. * Import Widgets Proceed to the overview panel to specify these inputs and configurations. 4.2.1 Step 1: Select Subject Enter the code for the demo subject whose iEEG data you want to import into RAVE. Note that a subject‚Äôs data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within therave_data folder. E.g. if you want to select demo subject KC, enter ‚ÄúKC‚Äù and you should receive the following message letting you know the subject has been found: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/raw_dir/KC (found!) 4.2.2 Step 2: Select Project or Create New One This step allows you to specify where you want the cleaned data to be stored. If you wish to create a new project, select ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the data directory (data_dir) within rave_data, with a new folder for the subject. E.g. if you wish to store demo subject KC in a new project called ‚ÄúTest‚Äù, you should receive the following message: Subject [Test/KC] will be stored at: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/data_dir/Test/KC Then, click ‚Äúcreate subject‚Äù to proceed. 4.2.3 Step 3: Validate Data In this step, you will have to specify your desired electrode (aka channel) options: Folders: Each folder corresponds to a block, aka a period or session of continuous electrode recording. Select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. (E.g. for KC, you could select blocks 003 and 004.) Electrodes: Indicate the electrodes you want to analyze. Note that it is reccomended that you run the preprocessing steps on all electrodes at once. (E.g. for KC, you should indicate 1-92.) Sample Rate: Indicate the sample rate of your iEEG recording equipment; this value will determine the rate at which the preprocessing will be run. For demo subjects, you can indicate 2000. Physical Unit: Indicate the units you wish to use to measure voltage. Demo data can be kept at the default as-is (no change) option. File Format: RAVE currently supports six file formats for your iEEG data. Demo data is stored using .mat/.h5 files, in which one file represents one electrode in a given block. (For guidance when selecting a file format, RAVE will briefly describe the format and display a sample organization of the directory.) Click the Check Subject button to proceed. (Note: this process can take a few minutes; progress will be displayed via pop-ups in the bottom right.) Click the Start Import button to proceed. (Note: this process can take a few minutes.) You have successfully imported a demo subject into RAVE. You can proceed to the preprocessing modules for further cleaning of this data. The following screenshot summarizes the data loading process: 4.3 Importing Your Own Data If you‚Äôre ready to start using RAVE with your own data, follow the steps below to import the data so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules. 4.3.1 Organizing Your Directories rave::archive_subject "],["preprocessing.html", "Chapter 5 Preprocessing 5.1 Part One 5.2 Part Two 5.3 Part Three", " Chapter 5 Preprocessing 5.1 Part One Step #1: Import Signals Now that you have installed and gotten started with RAVE, you can proceed to importing your iEEG data into the software so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules. Step 1.1: Select project &amp; subject First, use the drop down menu to specify which project you want the cleaned subject data to be stored in. If you wish to create a new project, select ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the rave_data folder of the data directory (data_dir), in a new folder for your subject. Next, use the drop down menu to select the code for the subject whose data you want to import. Note that a subject‚Äôs data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within therave_data folder. Click the ‚ÄúCreate Subject‚Äù button to proceed to the next step. Step 1.2: Format &amp; session blocks RAVE defines a block/session as a period of continuous electrode recording. Here, you should first select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. Note that when you select a block, a preview of the files it contains will pop-up to the right. This feature helps you check that the way you‚Äôve stored your data is consistent with the file type you‚Äôve selected. Then, specify the file format your iEEG data is stored in. RAVE currently supports four file formats: .mat/.h5 file per electrode per block single .mat/.h5 file per block single EDF(+) file per block single BrainVision file Note that when you select a format from the drop down, a brief description of the specific format will pop-up underneath the menu. For more information on these file types, visit the Q&amp;A at Importing Data Step 1.3: Channel information RAVE equates a channel to an electrode. Set the following specifications for your channels: Data file: Channel numbers: Indicate the electrodes you wish to analyze. It is recommended that you run the preprocessing steps on all electrodes at once. Note that RAVE can automatically detect potential electrodes based on the specified blocks and file type; this suggestion is displayed at the bottom of the panel. Physical unit: Indicate the units you wish to use to measure voltage. Sample rate: Indicate the rate of your iEEG recording equipment; this value will determine the rate at which the preprocessing will be run. Now, select the Validate &amp; Import button to validate your data. A pop-up will soon appear asking if you are ready to import your data. Please double check all the information you entered is correct, and then select the Import Data button to proceed. You will see a progress bar in the bottom left corner. A pop-up will soon appear indicating that you have successfully imported your subject data into RAVE. You can then proceed to the first preprocessing module, notch filter, for further cleaning of this data. Step #2: Notch Filter Begin in the Data Selection window to specify which data you want to perform the notch filter on. Use the drop down to indicate the desired project and subject. Note that you can press the Sync from [Import LFP] module link to automatically select the project and subject that you just imported in the Import Signals module. Proceed by selecting the Load Subject button. A new screen will load with three panels: Filter Settings: Specify configurations for the filter Inspection: Controls settings of the notch Notch: Inspect Signals: Displays *raw and filtered iEEG signals for each channel whose data was imported Refer to the following screenshot for further guidance.

Questions are organized by section. 6.1 Installation Question: When updating RAVE, I received a ‚Äútimeout of 60 seconds was reached‚Äù warning message. How do I fix this? &gt; Answer: Try switching to a faster network connection. Question: I already have R and RStudio downloaded. Can I skip the prerequisites? &gt; Answer: RAVE is dependent on the most recent versions of these applications, so please make sure they are properly updated. Be sure to also review the other pre-requisite steps, like installing Homebrew and the system libraries. The most common reason for issues in the installation of RAVE is failure to properly download these prerequisites. Question: How can I check my computer‚Äôs OS version or CPU type? &gt; Answer: If you‚Äôre using a Mac, this can be found by clicking the apple logo at the top left of your screen, and then clicking ‚ÄúAbout this Mac‚Äù. The version and processor (CPU type) will be listed there. Question: I received a ‚Äúthe following directories are not writable by your user‚Äù error. How do I fix this? &gt; Answer: If you have multiple accounts on your computer but only one of them has homebrew installed, you may receive that error. To resolve it, you can change the ownership of the directories to the current user and make sure this user has write permission. 6.2 Getting Started with RAVE Question: I copied a command into the RStudio console, but nothing is happening. What is the issue? &gt; Make sure you click the red stop sign at the top right of the console to stop the current command. This is necessary if you want to execute a different command. 6.3 Downloading Demo Data Question: I received this message when trying to import a demo subject. /Users/aliavyanne/rave_data/raw_dir/YAI (NOT found) /Users/aliavyanne/rave_data/bids_dir//Test/sub-YAI (NOT found) How do I fix this? Answer: You forgot to download this demo subject before importing them. You can use the following command to download the demo subject YAI: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAI&quot;) Question: Where does the demo data come from? &gt; Answer: The demo data available in RAVE is sourced from experiments run by the Beauchamp Lab at the Perelman School of Medicine, which investigates the neural mechanisms for multisensory integration and visual perception in human subjects. Read more at: https://www.med.upenn.edu/beauchamplab/ 6.4 Importing Data Question: What does the term ‚Äúchannel‚Äù refer to? &gt; Answer: In the early design of RAVE, we focused on exploring one channel per electrode cases, hence we equivalent ‚Äúchannel‚Äù to ‚Äúelectrode‚Äù here. Question: In step 3, why are the ‚Äúfolders‚Äù and ‚Äúelectrode‚Äù fields designated as ‚Äúread-only‚Äù? Answer: If these fields are designated as ‚Äúread only,‚Äù this means you have already imported the entered subject. To preserve reproducibility, once raw data for a subject is imported and notch filtered, you can not change the channel options. Question: In step 3, what does the term ‚Äúblock‚Äù refer to? Answer: RAVE defines ‚Äúblock‚Äù as a period or session of continuous recording. A block should be named with a zero-padded integer according to the order they were recorded (e.g.¬†001 for the first session, 002 for the second). Question: On the import widgets panel at bottom right, I got a message that electrode files are missing. How do I resolve this? Answer: When you hit the ‚Äúcheck subject‚Äù button, the bottom right panel will let you know if any electrode files are missing based on the electrode numbers you entered in step three. Be sure to double check that you indicated the correct electrode numbers in step 3. Question: Does RAVE automatically validate my data? &gt; Answer: You should check for yourself to make sure that each block contains the appropriate files. RAVE will not automatically check this for you. Question: How do I know which file format to select in step 3? &gt; Answer: When you select a file format from the drop down, RAVE will display brief information on what that format entails and a sample organization for the data directory. Select the format that matches that of your data. Question: Where are my inputs and configurations stored for a given subject? &gt; Answer: This information is stored within data_dir/&lt;project&gt;/subject&gt;/rave/preprocess/rave.yaml of your home directory. Question: I‚Äôve already performed the notch filter, but RAVE is not letting me update my channel options. How can I fix this? &gt; Answer: Once the data is imported and notch filtered, you cannot change the channel options. You should make a new project to change the channel options in this case. "]]
