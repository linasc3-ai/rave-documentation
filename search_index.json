System: Allows you to change RAM and number of CPU cores RAVE can use to alter speed at which data is read 3D Viewer: Allows you to change which downloaded brain data to use as the template brain for electrode template mapping; the default template brain is N27. Note: In general, you must stop processes that are currently being executed by the console before trying to initiate another command. To do this, click the red stop sign on the bottom left panel of RStudio. For example, if you have just opened RAVE and wish to update the application, click the red stop sign. Refer to the following screenshot for guidance. "],["import-data.html", "Chapter 4 Import Data 4.1 Downloading demo data 4.2 Importing demo data 4.3 Importing Your Own Data", " Chapter 4 Import Data Now that you have installed and gotten started with RAVE, you can proceed to importing your iEEG data into the software so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules. 4.1 Downloading demo data Before importing your own data, you may wish to gain familiarity by trying RAVE‚Äôs demo data in various modules. By default, RAVE already has a DemoSubject whose raw data has already been imported. However, you can also download other demo subjects by copying and pasting the following command into the RStudio console: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;subject_code&quot;) You will need to substitute ‚Äúsubject_code‚Äù with one of the available demo subjects: KC, YAB, YAD, YAF, YAH, YAI, YAJ, and YAK. For example, to download subject YAB, use the following command: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAB&quot;) Note that downloaded demo data will be stored in the raw_dir folder of the rave_data folder in your home directory. Within raw_dir, each subject‚Äôs data is stored in its own folder (e.g.¬†YAB‚Äôs data will be stored in the YAB folder in raw_dir). Refer to the following screenshot for clarity. Screenshot of location of downloaded demo data You can proceed to the ‚Äúimporting demo data‚Äù instructions to load your newly downloaded raw data into RAVE for cleaning. 4.2 Importing demo data You will need to launch the RAVE preprocessing module. Copy and paste the following command into the RStudio console: rave::rave_preprocess() The Preprocessing module will then open in a browser window, allowing you to see the Overview page. The Overview page is where you will import or load your data into RAVE. It consists of three panels. * Overview: this is where you will specify your inputs and configurations. * Information: a summary of your inputs and configurations is shown here. * Import Widgets Proceed to the overview panel to specify these inputs and configurations. 4.2.1 Step 1: Select Subject Enter the code for the demo subject whose iEEG data you want to import into RAVE. Note that a subject‚Äôs data should be stored in its own folder within the raw directory (raw_dir folder) within therave_data folder. E.g. if you want to select demo subject KC, enter ‚ÄúKC‚Äù and you should receive the following message letting you know the subject has been found: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/raw_dir/KC (found!) 4.2.2 Step 2: Select Project or Create New One This step allows you to specify where you want the cleaned data to be stored. If you wish to create a new project, select ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù from the drop down menu and indicate your desired project name. Note that by default, this project folder will be created within the data directory (data_dir) within rave_data, with a new folder for the subject. E.g. if you wish to store demo subject KC in a new project called ‚ÄúTest‚Äù, you should receive the following message: Subject [Test/KC] will be stored at: /Users/your_home_directory/rave_data/data_dir/Test/KC Then, click ‚Äúcreate subject‚Äù to proceed. 4.2.3 Step 3: Validate Data In this step, you will have to specify your desired electrode (aka channel) options: Folders: Each folder corresponds to a block, aka a period or session of continuous electrode recording. Select the blocks that correspond to the trials you want to analyze. (E.g. for KC, you could select blocks 003 and 004.) Electrodes: Indicate the electrodes you want to analyze. Note that it is reccomended that you run the preprocessing steps on all electrodes at once. (E.g. for KC, you should indicate 1-92.) Sample Rate: Indicate the sample rate of your iEEG recording equipment; this value will determine the rate at which the preprocessing will be run. For demo subjects, you can indicate 2000. Physical Unit: Indicate the units you wish to use to measure voltage. Demo data can be kept at the default as-is (no change) option. File Format: RAVE currently supports six file formats for your iEEG data. Demo data is stored using .mat/.h5 files, in which one file represents one electrode in a given block. (For guidance when selecting a file format, RAVE will briefly describe the format and display a sample organization of the directory.) Click the Check Subject button to proceed. (Note: this process can take a few minutes; progress will be displayed via pop-ups in the bottom right.) Click the Start Import button to proceed. (Note: this process can take a few minutes.) You have successfully imported a demo subject into RAVE. You can proceed to the preprocessing modules for further cleaning of this data. The following screenshot summarizes the data loading process: 4.3 Importing Your Own Data If you‚Äôre ready to start using RAVE with your own data, follow the steps below to import the data so that it can be preprocessed and used in future modules. 4.3.1 Organizing Your Directories rave::archive_subject "],["preprocessing.html", "Chapter 5 Preprocessing 5.1 Step #1: Notch Filter 5.2 Step #2: Wavelet 5.3 Step #3: Localization", " Chapter 5 Preprocessing 5.1 Step #1: Notch Filter 5.2 Step #2: Wavelet 5.3 Step #3: Localization "],["qas.html", "Chapter 6 Q&amp;As 6.1 Installation 6.2 Getting Started with RAVE 6.3 Downloading Demo Data 6.4 Importing Data", " Chapter 6 Q&amp;As This page contains possible questions that may arise when using RAVE and their answers. Questions are organized by section. 6.1 Installation Question: When updating RAVE, I received a ‚Äútimeout of 60 seconds was reached‚Äù warning message. How do I fix this? &gt; Answer: Try switching to a faster network connection. Question: I already have R and RStudio downloaded. Can I skip the prerequisites? &gt; Answer: RAVE is dependent on the most recent versions of these applications, so please make sure they are properly updated. Be sure to also review the other pre-requisite steps, like installing Homebrew and the system libraries. The most common reason for issues in the installation of RAVE is failure to properly download these prerequisites. Question: How can I check my computer‚Äôs OS version or CPU type? &gt; Answer: If you‚Äôre using a Mac, this can be found by clicking the apple logo at the top left of your screen, and then clicking ‚ÄúAbout this Mac‚Äù. The version and processor (CPU type) will be listed there. Question: I received a ‚Äúthe following directories are not writable by your user‚Äù error. How do I fix this? &gt; Answer: If you have multiple accounts on your computer but only one of them has homebrew installed, you may receive that error. To resolve it, you can change the ownership of the directories to the current user and make sure this user has write permission. 6.2 Getting Started with RAVE Question: I copied a command into the RStudio console, but nothing is happening. What is the issue? &gt; Make sure you click the red stop sign at the top right of the console to stop the current command. This is necessary if you want to execute a different command. 6.3 Downloading Demo Data Question: I received this message when trying to import a demo subject. /Users/aliavyanne/rave_data/raw_dir/YAI (NOT found) /Users/aliavyanne/rave_data/bids_dir//Test/sub-YAI (NOT found) How do I fix this? Answer: You forgot to download this demo subject before importing them. You can use the following command to download the demo subject YAI: rave::download_sample_data(&quot;YAI&quot;) Question: Where does the demo data come from? &gt; Answer: The demo data available in RAVE is sourced from experiments run by the Beauchamp Lab at the Perelman School of Medicine, which investigates the neural mechanisms for multisensory integration and visual perception in human subjects. Read more at: https://www.med.upenn.edu/beauchamplab/ 6.4 Importing Data Question: What does the term ‚Äúchannel‚Äù refer to? &gt; Answer: In the early design of RAVE, we focused on exploring one channel per electrode cases, hence we equivalent ‚Äúchannel‚Äù to ‚Äúelectrode‚Äù here. Question: In step 3, why are the ‚Äúfolders‚Äù and ‚Äúelectrode‚Äù fields designated as ‚Äúread-only‚Äù? Answer: If these fields are designated as ‚Äúread only,‚Äù this means you have already imported the entered subject. To preserve reproducibility, once raw data for a subject is imported and notch filtered, you can not change the channel options. Question: In step 3, what does the term ‚Äúblock‚Äù refer to? Answer: RAVE defines ‚Äúblock‚Äù as a period or session of continuous recording. A block should be named with a zero-padded integer according to the order they were recorded (e.g.¬†001 for the first session, 002 for the second). Question: On the import widgets panel at bottom right, I got a message that electrode files are missing. How do I resolve this? Answer: When you hit the ‚Äúcheck subject‚Äù button, the bottom right panel will let you know if any electrode files are missing based on the electrode numbers you entered in step three. Be sure to double check that you indicated the correct electrode numbers in step 3. Question: Does RAVE automatically validate my data? &gt; Answer: You should check for yourself to make sure that each block contains the appropriate files. RAVE will not automatically check this for you. Question: How do I know which file format to select in step 3? &gt; Answer: When you select a file format from the drop down, RAVE will display brief information on what that format entails and a sample organization for the data directory. Select the format that matches that of your data. Question: Where are my inputs and configurations stored for a given subject? &gt; Answer: This information is stored within data_dir/&lt;project&gt;/subject&gt;/rave/preprocess/rave.yaml of your home directory. Question: I‚Äôve already performed the notch filter, but RAVE is not letting me update my channel options. How can I fix this? &gt; Answer: Once the data is imported and notch filtered, you cannot change the channel options. You should make a new project to change the channel options in this case. "]]
